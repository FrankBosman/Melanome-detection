# Melanoma Detection
Comparing CNN methods for melanoma detection and adapting them for resource-limited at-home self-checks.

## Why Melanoma Detection?
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive form of skin cancer that caused 331722 new cases and approximately 58,667 deaths globally in the year 2022, which makes melanoma responsible for 75% of skin cancer death. Early detection of melanoma is crucial because survival rates are over 90% when caught early, but drops greatly in later stages.<br>
This repository aims to compare different CNN methods for melanoma detection and adapt them for resource-limited at-home self-checks.

## Usage
In order to use this repo you will have to add a few things yourself: The dataset and the trained models.


### Dataset
For the dataset we use the [Kaggle Melanoma Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanderdust/skin-lesion-analysis-toward-melanoma-detection/data). You can download the dataset and put it in the `datasets` folder.
It might be easier and faster to use the Kaggle API to download the dataset, you can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/blob/main/docs/README.md).<br>
> [!NOTE] 
> There is a notebook in the dataset folder that can directly download it from Kaggle.

## Trained Models
The trained models are stored in teams, just download them and put them in the `models` folder.
